# SimCNC Janis Screen

This is a **Janis_Screen for SimCNC**, designed and created by me.  
It modifies the default interface to better suit my workflow, but others might also find it useful.

> ⚠️ **Safety Notice**  
> This screen includes probing and tool length measurement features that can cause the machine to move automatically.  
> Movements may be unexpected depending on machine configuration or custom code.  
> Always monitor the machine closely when using these functions, and proceed with caution to avoid collisions or damage.
